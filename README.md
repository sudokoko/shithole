# shithole
public file dump backend (and a sample frontend)

## how do i run this?
i don't currently provide support. you will need apache2 and nodejs (obviously). it should handle file transfer to the default apache2 directory itself provided it has access to the directory. i literally just did `chmod -R 777 /var/www/html` because i don't care lol
