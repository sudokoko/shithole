# temporarily stepping back
i'm going to step back from shithole development for a while. shithole.ml has been shut down, however an archive has been created. this should still work if you figure out how to get it working. feel free to open a PR if you want to add something and i'll review it.

**public file dump backend (and a sample frontend)**

## how do i run this?
i don't currently provide support. you will need apache2 and nodejs (obviously). it should handle file transfer to the default apache2 directory itself provided it has access to the directory. i literally just did `chmod -R 777 /var/www/html` because i don't care lol
